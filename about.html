        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <p class="blurb">I am Brian White. I am 33 years old and currently work as a nurse. I am married with a 2 year old daughter. I am aspiring to be a software developer. I enjoy solving problems that can actually be solved even if they are complex. I enjoy seeing a tangible outcome from my work. In my porfolio I have projects that I have worked on here and there as time and work have permitted. They can be seen by clicking on the gitHub button in my nav bar. I will continue to improve upon my existing code as well as continue learning and creating new projects. I am excited to see what this journey has in store for my life and the opporotunities I will have to make a true difference in the world.</p>
